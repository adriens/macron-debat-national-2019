Dear French, Dear French,
My dear compatriots,

In a period of questions and uncertainties
like the one we are going through, we
must remember who we are.

France is not a country like the others.

The meaning of injustice is more vivid than elsewhere.
The need for mutual aid and solidarity stronger.

At home, those who work are financing
retirees pensions. With us, a big
number of citizens pay an income tax,
sometimes heavy, which reduces inequalities. In
we, education, health, security, justice
are accessible to everyone regardless of
the situation and the fortune. The difficulties of
life, like unemployment, can be
overcome, thanks to the effort shared by all.

That is why France is, of all
nations, one of the most fraternal and most
egalitarian.

It's also one of the freest, since everyone
is protected in his rights and freedom
of opinion, conscience, belief or
philosophy.

And every citizen has the right to choose those
and those who will carry his voice in driving
of the country, in the drafting of laws, in
big decisions to make.

Everyone shares the fate of others and everyone
is called to decide the destiny of all: it is
all this, the French Nation.

How not to feel pride in being
French?

I know, of course, that some of us
are today dissatisfied or angry. By
that taxes are too high for them,
public services too far away, because the
wages are too low for some
can live worthily the fruit of their work,
because our country does not offer the same
chances to succeed depending on the place or family
Where we come from. All would like a country more
prosperous and a more just society.

This ambition, I share it. The society that
we want is a society in which
to succeed we should not need
of relationships or fortune, but of effort and
job.

In France, but also in Europe and in the
world, not only a great worry,
but also a big trouble have won the
minds. We need to respond with ideas
clear.

But there is one condition: to accept
no form of violence. I do not accept the
pressure and insult, for example on the elected
of the people, I do not accept and do not have the right
to accept the general indictment, by
example of the media, journalists, institutions
and officials. If everyone
attack everyone, society gets rid of!

So that expectations dominate fears,
it is necessary and legitimate that we
let's put together the big questions of
our future.

** That's why I proposed
and I'm launching today a big
national debate that will take place
until March 15th. **

In recent weeks, mayors have
open their town halls so you can
express your expectations I had first
returns that I could take into account. We
let's go into a more phase
ample and you can participate in debates
near you or express yourself on
internet to put forward your proposals and
your ideas. In France, overseas and
with French residents abroad.
In villages, towns, neighborhoods,
on the initiative of mayors, elected officials, officials
associations, or ordinary citizens ...
In parliamentary assemblies like
regional or departmental.

Mayors will have a vital role as they are
your elected representatives and therefore the legitimate intermediary of
the expression of the citizens.

For me, there are no forbidden questions.
We will not agree on everything, it's
normal is democracy. But at least
will we show that we are a people
who is not afraid to speak, to exchange, to
discuss.

And maybe we'll discover that we
can agree, mostly
beyond our preferences, more often than
do not believe it.

I did not forget that I was elected on a project,
on major orientations to which I
remain faithful. I still think he
must restore France's prosperity to
that she can be generous because one is going
with the other. I still think that the fight
against unemployment must be our big
priority, and that employment is created first and foremost
in companies, so it takes their
give the means to develop.
I still think we need to rebuild
industrial sovereignty, digital and
to invest in knowledge
and research. I still think it takes
rebuild a school of trust, a system
renovated social to better protect the French
and reduce inequalities at the root.
I still think that the exhaustion of
natural resources and disruption
climate change compels us to rethink our
development model. We must
invent a productive, social, educational project,
environmental and European new, more
just and more effective. On these major orientations,
my determination has not changed.

But I also think that from this debate can
come out a clarification of our national project and
European, new ways of thinking
the future, new ideas.

In this debate, I wish that the greatest
number of French, the largest number
of us, can participate.

This debate will have to answer questions
essential issues that have emerged in recent weeks.
That is why, with the Government,
we selected four major themes that
cover a lot of the big issues of the
Nation: taxation and public spending,
the organization of the state and public services,
ecological transition, democracy and
citizenship. On each of these themes,
proposals, questions are already
expressed. I wish to formulate some
some who do not exhaust the debate but
seem to be at the heart of our questions.

** The first subject is
on our taxes, our expenses
and public action. **

Tax is at the heart of our solidarity
National. He is the one who finances our services
public. He comes to pay the teachers,
firefighters, policemen, military, magistrates,
nurses and all public servants who work
at your service. It allows to pay to the most
fragile social benefits but also
finance some big projects for the future,
our research, our culture, or to maintain
our infrastructures. It is also the tax that
allows to settle the interests of the debt very
important that our country has contracted over
time.

But the tax, when it is too high, deprives
our resource economy that could
usefully invest in companies, creating
and employment and growth. And he deprives
the workers the fruit of their efforts. We
will not revisit the measures we
have taken to correct this to encourage
investment and make that work
pay more. They have just been voted and
are just beginning to deliver their effects.
Parliament will evaluate them transparently
and with the necessary hindsight. We
must instead interrogate us to go
further.

How could we make our tax
more just and more effective? Which taxes should
it to your eyes lower in priority?

We can not, anyway, continue
tax cuts without lowering the level
of our public expenditure.

What are the savings that seem to you
priority to do?

Should certain public services be abolished
which would be overwhelmed or too expensive by
compared to their usefulness? Conversely, do you see
new needs for public services
and how to finance them?

Our social model is also questioned.
Some consider it insufficient, others
too expensive because of the contributions they
pay. The effectiveness of training as
employment services is often criticized.
The Government began to
respond, after wide consultations,
through a strategy to improve our
health, to fight against poverty and against
unemployment.

How to better organize our pact
social? Which objectives should be prioritized?

** The second subject on which
we must take
decisions, it's the organization
state and community
public. **

Utilities have a cost but they are
vital: school, police, army, hospitals, courts
are essential to our social cohesion.

Are there too many administrative levels or
levels of local government? Should
strengthen decentralization and give
more power of decision and action
closer to the citizens? At what levels
and for which services?

How would you like the state to be
organized and how can it improve
his action? Should we review the functioning
of administration and how?

How the state and local authorities
can they improve to better answer
to the challenges of our most
in difficulty and what do you propose?

** The ecological transition
is the third theme,
essential to our future. **

I committed to preservation goals
biodiversity and the fight against
global warming and air pollution.
Today nobody challenges the driving force
need to act quickly. The longer we wait for us
questioning, plus these transformations
will be painful.

Making the ecological transition allows
reduce fuel-constrained expenditures,
in heating, waste management and
transport. But to succeed in this transition, he
must invest heavily and accompany our
fellow citizens the most modest.

National solidarity is needed to
that all the French can do it.

How to finance the transition
ecological: by taxes, by taxes and by
should be concerned in priority?

How to make concrete solutions
accessible to all, for example to replace
his old boiler or his old car
? What are the simplest solutions
and the most bearable on a financial level?

What are the solutions to move,
to lodge, to warm themselves, to feed themselves
be conceived rather at the local level than
national? What concrete proposals
would you do to speed up our transition
environmental?

The question of biodiversity also arises
to us all.

How should we guarantee scientifically
the choices we have to make to this
respect ? How to share these choices
at European and international level for
that our farmers and our industrialists
are not penalized in relation to their
foreign competitors?

** Finally, it is obvious that
the period that our country
crosses shows we need
give more strength to the
democracy and citizenship. **

Being a citizen means helping to decide
of the future of the country by the election of
representatives at the local, national or
European. This system of representation
is the bedrock of our Republic but
it needs to be improved because many do not feel
not represented at the end of the elections.

Should the white vote be recognized?
Should we make voting compulsory?

What is the right dose of proportional
in parliamentary elections for a representation
more fair of all political projects?

Should we, and in what proportions, limit
the number of parliamentarians or others
categories of elected?

What role do our assemblies, including the Senate
and the Economic, Social and
Environmental, should they play for
represent our territories and civil society?
Should we transform them and how?

In addition, a great democracy like
France must be able to listen more
often the voice of its citizens.

What changes do you want for
make citizen participation more active,
more participative democracy?

Should we associate more directly
non-elected citizens, for example
by lot, by public decision?

Should we increase the use of referendums
and who should have the initiative?

Citizenship is also about living
together.

Our country has always known how to welcome those who have
fled wars, persecutions and sought
refuge on our soil: it is the right of asylum, which does not
can not be questioned. Our community
national level has also always been open to those
who, born elsewhere, chose France,
looking for a better future: this is
as it was also built.
However, this tradition is today shaken up by
tensions and doubts related to immigration
and failures of our integration system.

What do you propose to improve integration
in our Nation? In immigration matters,
once our asylum obligations are fulfilled,
do you want us to be able to fix ourselves
annual targets set by Parliament?
What are you proposing to meet this challenge
who will last?

The question of secularism is still in France
subject of important debates. Secularism is the
primordial value so that can live
together, in good intelligence and harmony,
different convictions, religious or
philosophical. It is synonymous with freedom
because it allows everyone to live by
his choices.

How to strengthen the principles of secularism
in the relationship between the State and
the religions of our country?
How to ensure respect by all
mutual understanding and values
intangibles of the Republic?

In the coming weeks, I invite you
to debate to answer these questions
decisive for the future of our Nation.
I also wish you could go beyond
of these subjects that I propose to you, to evoke
any concrete topic you would have
the impression that it could improve your
everyday existence.

This debate is an unprecedented initiative of which I have the
firm will draw all the conclusions.
This is neither an election nor a referendum.
It's your personal expression,
corresponding to your story, your opinions, your
priorities, which is here expected, without distinction
age and social condition. It is, I believe,
a big step forward for our Republic
than to consult its citizens in this way. For
guarantee your freedom of speech I want that
this consultation is organized in
independence, and be framed by all
guarantees of loyalty and transparency.

This is how I intend to transform with you
anger in solutions.

Your proposals will help build
a new contract for the Nation, to structure
the action of the Government and the Parliament,
but also the positions of France at
European and international. I will give you some
account directly in the month following the
end of debate.

Dear French, dear French, my dear ones
compatriots, I wish the greatest
many of you can participate in this
great debate in order to do useful work for
the future of our country.

In trust,
Emmanuel Macron
